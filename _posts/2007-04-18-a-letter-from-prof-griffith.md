Last month I bought a book entitled *Writing Essays about Literature* by American Prof. Kelly Griffith at University of North Carolina. This book is well-written and helps enthusiastic literature students a lot, just like me. I am trying hard to absorb its essence. But there are numerous questions designed to test students or readers' abilities of understanding literature. I know these questions may be open, without definite answers. But I do hope Prof. Griffith could give me a helping hand--is it possible for him to tell me some tips to answer these questions or to do more interactions with him and his readers around the world? Therefore I sent him an email. To my suprise, I heard from him soon.
