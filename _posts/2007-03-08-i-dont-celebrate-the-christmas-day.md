Although I am quite familiar with the origin and celebrations of Christmas Day, the most important festival in the western world, actually I’ve never got the idea of participating its crazy celebrations, which could terrify foreign guests. Some of my classmates now are working as policemen. For them, Christmas Day is their yearly ultimate nightmare and disgusting experience. Just imagine millions of people gathering at Chunxi Road and Tianfu Square! Every moment is rush hour and all the major avenues are thronged with purposeless city dwellers. The police force must make sure the Christmas celebrations under control－ no one will be injured during the heavy traffic. Therefore to deal with this instant stream of people and cars, no policeman can stay at home as an outsider. The flood of people is sure to be their formidable “enemy” tonight. My friends complained as usual, “Where the hell do these people come from? ” “I have no hope of being quiet today!” I didn't have such complains, but I understood them. One of our unique Christmas celebrations is to use a sort of air-filled toy to hit one another on the face. I guess foreign friends never dream of that. If you intend to “fight” back, you are doomed. People will greet you with shouting, crying and air-filled toy hitting.
