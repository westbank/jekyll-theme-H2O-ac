A profound and wonderful photo from Paul who describes it thusly "the traditional festival in Sao Bartolomeu do Mar, occurs through out August and culminates on the 24th with the famous Bano Santo (holy bath)", which the local people believe has the power to protect children's health and allievate sickness.

This photo should be perceived in a divine sense. The child is coming from a sacred bath done by the fisherman. It is an ancient ritual against the devil and he must be bathed in the ocean by a fisherman three times in three waves during three days. The child is crying bitterly and the fisherman's got a worried look. Hmmmmmm, but why?
